# UltraNumber-MVP
A C++ library that will allow a user to work with exceptionally long numbers, which would normally be limited by the constraints of their data types.
The length of the numbers are only limited by your computers memory.

By defualt the highest value a C++ program can hold or operate with is an unsigned long long with a max value of about 18.5 quintillion. 18.5 x 10^18
This program (soon to be library) can do math on numbers with exponentionally higher values.
